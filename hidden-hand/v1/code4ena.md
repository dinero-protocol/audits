# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Redacted Cartel smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between February 15—February 17 2022.

## Wardens

37 Wardens contributed reports to the Redacted Cartel contest:

# Medium Risk Findings (18)
## [[M-01] Manipulations of `setFee`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel-findings/issues/113)
_Submitted by pauliax_

[BribeVault.sol#L104-L113](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L104-L113)<br>
[BribeVault.sol#L164](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L164)<br>
[BribeVault.sol#L213](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L213)<br>
[BribeVault.sol#L256](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L256)<br>

If we consider that the fee variable is meaningfully applied, there will still be several problems with this:

1.  Admin can setFee up to 100%. This is bad for users, fees should have a reasonable upper limit, e.g. 30% to prevent potential griefing.
2.  Tokens are transferred in a separate function called transferBribes, which means that depositBribe txs have already settled. setFee can happen anytime, so an admin can change fees for already made deposits. I think this is again bad for users, as you need extra trust on an admin to not exploit this, and smart contracts should aim for as little external trust as possible.
3.  Even if a fee would be applied in depositBribe, function setFee could frontrun user deposits. Consider using a timelock, so that users have time to react and adjust.

**[kphed (Redacted Cartel) disagreed with Medium severity and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel-findings/issues/113#issuecomment-1043705156):**
 > We will likely set an upper bound as recommended, to ease user concerns. The admin being the Redacted multisig should also instill much trust and address most concerns.

## [[M-02] DEPOSITOR_ROLE can be granted by the deployer of `BribeVault` and transfer briber's approved ERC20 tokens to `bribeVault` by specifying any `bribeIdentifier` and `rewardIdentifier`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel-findings/issues/1)
_Submitted by cccz_

In the depositBribeERC20() function of the TokemakBribe contract, the briber can specify a proposal, and then call the depositBribeERC20 function of the bribeVault contract to deposit the reward.

        function depositBribeERC20(
            address proposal,
            address token,
            uint256 amount
        ) external {
            uint256 currentRound = _round;
            require(
                proposalDeadlines[proposal] > block.timestamp,
                "Proposal deadline has passed"
            );
            require(token != address(0), "Invalid token");
            require(amount > 0, "Bribe amount must be greater than 0");

            bytes32 bribeIdentifier = generateBribeVaultIdentifier(
                proposal,
                currentRound,
                token
            );
            bytes32 rewardIdentifier = generateRewardIdentifier(
                currentRound,
                token
            );

            IBribeVault(bribeVault).depositBribeERC20(
                bribeIdentifier,
                rewardIdentifier,
                token,
                amount,
                msg.sender
            );

But in the depositBribeERC20 function of the bribeVault contract, the address with DEPOSITOR_ROLE can transfer the briber's approved ERC20 tokens to bribeVault by specifying any bribeIdentifier and rewardIdentifier via safeTransferFrom.

        function depositBribeERC20(
            bytes32 bribeIdentifier,
            bytes32 rewardIdentifier,
            address token,
            uint256 amount,
            address briber
        ) external onlyRole(DEPOSITOR_ROLE) {
            require(bribeIdentifier.length > 0, "Invalid bribeIdentifier");
            require(rewardIdentifier.length > 0, "Invalid rewardIdentifier");
            require(token != address(0), "Invalid token");
            require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
            require(briber != address(0), "Invalid briber");

            Bribe storage b = bribes[bribeIdentifier];
            address currentToken = b.token;
            require(
                // If bribers want to bribe with a different token they need a new identifier
                currentToken == address(0) || currentToken == token,
                "Cannot change token"
            );

            // Since this method is called by a depositor contract, we must transfer from the account
            // that called the depositor contract - amount must be approved beforehand
            IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(briber, address(this), amount);

DEPOSITOR_ROLE can be granted by the deployer of BribeVault.

```

    function grantDepositorRole(address depositor)
        external
        onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)
    {
        require(depositor != address(0), "Invalid depositor");
        _grantRole(DEPOSITOR_ROLE, depositor);

        emit GrantDepositorRole(depositor);
    }

```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The depositBribeERC20 function of the TokemakBribe contract needs to first transfer the briber's tokens to the TokemakBribe contract, and then transfer the tokens to the bribeVault contract in the depositBribeERC20 function of the bribeVault contract. Make sure the first parameter of safeTransferFrom is msg.sender.

TokemakBribe.depositBribeERC20()

        function depositBribeERC20(
            address proposal,
            address token,
            uint256 amount
        ) external {
            uint256 currentRound = _round;
            require(
                proposalDeadlines[proposal] > block.timestamp,
                "Proposal deadline has passed"
            );
            require(token != address(0), "Invalid token");
            require(amount > 0, "Bribe amount must be greater than 0");

            bytes32 bribeIdentifier = generateBribeVaultIdentifier(
                proposal,
                currentRound,
                token
            );
            bytes32 rewardIdentifier = generateRewardIdentifier(
                currentRound,
                token
            );
    +       IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

            IBribeVault(bribeVault).depositBribeERC20(
                bribeIdentifier,
                rewardIdentifier,
                token,
                amount,
                msg.sender
            );

bribeVault.depositBribeERC20()

```
    function depositBribeERC20(
        bytes32 bribeIdentifier,
        bytes32 rewardIdentifier,
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        address briber
    ) external onlyRole(DEPOSITOR_ROLE) {
        require(bribeIdentifier.length > 0, "Invalid bribeIdentifier");
        require(rewardIdentifier.length > 0, "Invalid rewardIdentifier");
        require(token != address(0), "Invalid token");
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        require(briber != address(0), "Invalid briber");

        Bribe storage b = bribes[bribeIdentifier];
        address currentToken = b.token;
        require(
            // If bribers want to bribe with a different token they need a new identifier
            currentToken == address(0) || currentToken == token,
            "Cannot change token"
        );

        // Since this method is called by a depositor contract, we must transfer from the account
        // that called the depositor contract - amount must be approved beforehand
-       IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(briber, address(this), amount);
+	IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

## [[M-03] `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` of `BribeVault` can steal tokens from users' wallets](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel-findings/issues/86)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by danb, Dravee, Alex the Entreprenerd, gzeon, IllIllI, jayjonah8, kenzo, pauliax, cmichel, csanuragjain, and z3s_

The current design/implementation allows the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` of `BribeVault` to steal funds from any address that approved this contract up to allowance:

As a `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, the attack is simply do the following steps:

    1. `grantDepositorRole()` to self;
    2. `BribeVault#depositBribeERC20()` and transfer funds from victim's wallet;
    3. `emergencyWithdrawERC20()`.

This can be effectively used as a backdoor/attack vector for a malicious/compromised wallet with `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` of `BribeVault` to steal all the tokens from users' wallets for these users who have approved `BribeVault`.

[BribeVault.sol#L164-L187](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/92c4d5810df7b9de15eae55dc7641c8b36cd799d/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L164-L187)<br>

```solidity
function depositBribeERC20(
    bytes32 bribeIdentifier,
    bytes32 rewardIdentifier,
    address token,
    uint256 amount,
    address briber
) external onlyRole(DEPOSITOR_ROLE) {
    require(bribeIdentifier.length > 0, "Invalid bribeIdentifier");
    require(rewardIdentifier.length > 0, "Invalid rewardIdentifier");
    require(token != address(0), "Invalid token");
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
    require(briber != address(0), "Invalid briber");

    Bribe storage b = bribes[bribeIdentifier];
    address currentToken = b.token;
    require(
        // If bribers want to bribe with a different token they need a new identifier
        currentToken == address(0) || currentToken == token,
        "Cannot change token"
    );

    // Since this method is called by a depositor contract, we must transfer from the account
    // that called the depositor contract - amount must be approved beforehand
    IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(briber, address(this), amount);
    ...
```

[BribeVault.sol#L80-L88](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/92c4d5810df7b9de15eae55dc7641c8b36cd799d/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L80-L88)<br>

```solidity
function grantDepositorRole(address depositor)
    external
    onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)
{
    require(depositor != address(0), "Invalid depositor");
    _grantRole(DEPOSITOR_ROLE, depositor);

    emit GrantDepositorRole(depositor);
}
```

### Proof of Concept

Given:

*   Alice (the victim) has approved `BribeVault` to spend `WBTC`;
*   Alice has `100e8 WBTC` in their wallet balance.

A malicious/compromised `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` of `BribeVault` can do the following to steal tokens from users' wallets.

1.  `grantDepositorRole()` to self;
2.  `depositBribeERC20()` with: `token` = `WBTC`, `amount` = `100e8`, and `briber` = Alice;
3.  `emergencyWithdrawERC20()` with:  `token` = `WBTC`, `amount` = `100e8`.

As a result, the `100e8 WBTC` belongs Alice is now stolen by the Hacker.

The steps above can be repeated for all tokens and users, effectively stealing all the token balances from all the wallets that approved `BribeVault` up to the allowance limit, which usually is unlimited.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.  Consider using `TokemakBribe` instead of `BribeVault` to hold users' allowances;
2.  Consider making sure that the `from` parameter of `transferFrom` can only be `msg.sender`;
3.  Consider using a multi-sig for the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` of `BribeVault`.

## [[M-04] Send ether with call instead of transfer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel-findings/issues/2)
_Submitted by kenta, also found by Dravee, hyh, Jujic, leastwood, and z3s_

Use call instead of transfer to send ether. And return value must be checked if sending ether is successful or not.
Sending ether with the transfer is no longer recommended.

## [[M-05] Wrong slippage check](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel-findings/issues/35)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by danb, Alex the Entreprenerd, hickuphh3, hyh, and WatchPug_

The `ThecosomataETH.addLiquidity` function computes the `expectedAmount` and then subtracts a slippage percentage from it.

```solidity
function addLiquidity(uint256 ethAmount, uint256 btrflyAmount) internal {
    uint256[2] memory amounts = [ethAmount, btrflyAmount];
    uint256 expectedAmount = ICurveCryptoPool(CURVEPOOL).calc_token_amount(
        amounts
    );
    uint256 minAmount = expectedAmount - ((expectedAmount * slippage) / 1000);

    ICurveCryptoPool(CURVEPOOL).add_liquidity(amounts, minAmount);
}
```

According to the [Curve docs 21.4](https://curve.readthedocs.io/\_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/), this amount is already exact and takes the slippage into account (but not fees).

If the pool is imbalanced, the `calc_token_amount` will already return a wrong amount and the additional slippage check on the wrong amount is unnecessary (except for the fees).

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider computing the minimum expected LP tokens off-chain and pass them to the `performUpkeep` function as a parameter to prevent sandwich attacks.

## [[M-06] `SafeERC20.sol` is imported but not used in the `transferBribes()` function ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel-findings/issues/4)
_Submitted by jayjonah8, also found by cccz, cmichel, Dravee, gzeon, hyh, IllIllI, leastwood, NoamYakov, and Omik_

In BribeVault.sol the transferBribes() function uses token.transfer() instead of token.safeTransfer.
Tokens that don’t correctly implement the latest EIP20 spec, like USDT, will be unusable in the protocol as they revert the transaction because of the missing return value.  The fact that the SafeERC20.sol library is imported at the top of the BribeVault.sol implies that safeTransfer should be being used but may have been forgotten.

### Proof of Concept

[BribeVault.sol#L296](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L296)<br>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

It's recommended to use OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.

## [[M-07] Changing `bribeVault` in `RewardDistributor.sol` will Lock Current ETH Rewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel-findings/issues/7)
_Submitted by kirk-baird, also found by WatchPug_

[RewardDistributor.sol#L178-#L182](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/RewardDistributor.sol#L178-#L182)<br>
[RewardDistributor.sol#L65-#L73](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/RewardDistributor.sol#L65-#L73)

Claiming of the ETH native currency requires `token` to be set to `bribeVault`. If the `bribeVault` is modified in `setBribeVault()` then users who have ETH rewards will now be considered to have `ERC20(bribeVault)` tokens. Since `bribeVault` is not an ERC20 token the `transfer()` call will fail and the users will not be able to claim their funds.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider removing the functionality to change the `bribeVault` or ensuring all funds have been withdraw i.e. `balanceOf(address(this)) == 0` before changing the `bribeVault`.

## [[M-08] Admin Privilege - Owner can rug via `ThecosomataETH.withdraw`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel-findings/issues/39)
_Submitted by Alex the Entreprenerd, also found by gzeon_

Due to the generalized nature of `withdraw` the function is a clear rug-vector, allowing the `owner` to steal all funds.

Ideally, you should add some validation logic to limit the tokens or the amounts that the owner can withdraw.

Additionally, it's important that you disclose the level of admin privilege and the risk it can cause to your users and depositors.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Disclose the admin privilege in your docs.<br>
Refactor the code to reduce it.

**[kphed (Redacted Cartel) disputed and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel-findings/issues/39#issuecomment-1042428554):**
 > The `owner` is our protocol multisig which has proven itself to be a trustworthy steward of funds (e.g. manages the Redacted treasury funds).
> 
> The `withdraw` method is simply a utility to remove any ERC20 tokens that are unintentionally received. There won't be any funds to steal since it's not intended for the Thecosomata contract to custody funds for any extended period of time: our keepers will constantly poll the contract so that any BTRFLY received gets paired with ETH and added to our Curve LP immediately - any excess is burned.

## [[M-09] Improper control over the versions of distributions' metadata may lead to repeated claims of rewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel-findings/issues/89)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

[BribeVault.sol#L317-L324](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/92c4d5810df7b9de15eae55dc7641c8b36cd799d/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L317-L324)<br>

```solidity
function updateRewardsMetadata(Common.Distribution[] calldata distributions)
    external
    onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)
{
    require(distributions.length > 0, "Invalid distributions");
    IRewardDistributor(distributor).updateRewardsMetadata(distributions);
}
```

In the current implementation, `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` of `BribeVault` can call `updateRewardsMetadata()` to update the rewards metadata for the specified identifiers.

When a distribution's metadata is updated, it will also increase the `updateCount` and reset the claimed tracker.

[RewardDistributor.sol#L97-L119](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/92c4d5810df7b9de15eae55dc7641c8b36cd799d/contracts/RewardDistributor.sol#L97-L119)<br>

```solidity
function updateRewardsMetadata(
        Common.Distribution[] calldata _distributions
    ) external {
        require(msg.sender == bribeVault, "Invalid access");
        require(_distributions.length > 0, "Invalid _distributions");

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _distributions.length; i++) {
            // Update the metadata and also increment the update to reset the claimed tracker
            Reward storage reward = rewards[_distributions[i].rewardIdentifier];
            reward.token = _distributions[i].token;
            reward.merkleRoot = _distributions[i].merkleRoot;
            reward.proof = _distributions[i].proof;
            reward.updateCount += 1;

            emit RewardMetadataUpdated(
                _distributions[i].rewardIdentifier,
                _distributions[i].token,
                _distributions[i].merkleRoot,
                _distributions[i].proof,
                reward.updateCount
            );
        }
    }
```

However, when the network is congested, `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` of `BribeVault` may mistakenly send 2 `updateRewardsMetadata()` txs, and the transactions can be packaged into different blocks.

Let's say there 2 `updateRewardsMetadata()` tx with the same calldata, if someone claims rewards in between the two txs, then they can claim again after the second transaction.

### Proof of Concept

Given:

*   `distributionA`'s proof is set wrong in `transferBribes()`
*   `Alice` is eligible for rewards in `distributionA`
*   the network is congested
*   current block number = 10000

1.  `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` of `BribeVault` tries to call `updateRewardsMetadata()` and update `distributionA`'s proof;
2.  After a while, since the prev tx is stucked, `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` of `BribeVault` calls `updateRewardsMetadata()` again with same calldata;
3.  The first tx got packed into block 10010;
4.  `Alice` calls `claim()` and got the reward;
5.  The 2nd tx got packed into block 10020;
6.  `Alice` calls `claim()` again and get the reward again.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change to:

```solidity
struct UpdateDistribution {
    bytes32 rewardIdentifier;
    address token;
    bytes32 merkleRoot;
    bytes32 proof;
    uint256 prevUpdateCount;
}

function updateRewardsMetadata(
    Common.UpdateDistribution[] calldata _distributions
) external {
    require(msg.sender == bribeVault, "Invalid access");
    require(_distributions.length > 0, "Invalid _distributions");

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _distributions.length; i++) {
        require(reward.updateCount == _distributions[i].prevUpdateCount, "Invalid updateCount");
        // Update the metadata and also increment the update to reset the claimed tracker
        Reward storage reward = rewards[_distributions[i].rewardIdentifier];
        reward.token = _distributions[i].token;
        reward.merkleRoot = _distributions[i].merkleRoot;
        reward.proof = _distributions[i].proof;
        reward.updateCount += 1;

        emit RewardMetadataUpdated(
            _distributions[i].rewardIdentifier,
            _distributions[i].token,
            _distributions[i].merkleRoot,
            _distributions[i].proof,
            reward.updateCount
        );
    }
}
```

## [[M-10] Distributions must not match actual bribes](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel-findings/issues/33)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `BribeVault.transferBribes` transfers tokens for distribution.<br>
All parameters (`amounts`, `distributions`) are blindly accepted by the function and never verified to match the actual bribes that were deposited for the `distributions[i].rewardIdentifier`.

The `distributions[i].token` must not match the `distributions[i].rewardIdentifier`'s token (included in the reward identifier hash), and the `amounts[i]` (and fees) must not match the `bribes[bribeIdentifier].amount`.

The admin can submit arbitrary values and create distributions that don't reflect the bribe the distribution is actually for.
It's easy to under-or overreport amounts for a bribe, take amounts from a different bribe, or steal all amounts from users by using 100% fees, distribute the same bribe over and over, etc.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Reduce the trust that users need to have in the admin by validating the `Common.Distribution[] calldata distributions`,  `uint256[] calldata amounts`, `uint256[] calldata fees` parameters against the deposited bribes.

For example:

*   Check that the `distributions[i].token` matches the `distributions[i].rewardIdentifier`
*   The amount + fees equal the `bribes[bribeIdentifier].amount`, then reset the `bribes[bribeIdentifier].amount`.

## [[M-11] Depositor can spend funds of another Depositor](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel-findings/issues/11)
_Submitted by csanuragjain_

1.  One depositor can spend funds of another depositor
2.  Depositor can deposit in expired proposal
3.  rewardIdentifier and bribeIdentifier can point to different rounds/tokens

### Proof of Concept

One depositor can spend funds of another depositor:

1.  Malicious depositor can call depositBribeERC20 at BribeVault.sol#L164 with briber as User B (Malicious user can generate bribeIdentifier with his own proposal)

2.  Assume this User B has approved amount x to this contract

3.  BribeVault.sol#L187 (IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(briber, address(this), amount);) will transfer this amount x to the contract due to call at step 1. All this happen without User B knowledge

Expired Proposal:

1.  Malicious depositor can generate bribeIdentifier of an expired proposal (proposalDeadlines\[proposal] < block.timestamp) using generateBribeVaultIdentifier at TokemakBribe.sol#L166

2.  Malicious depositor can then simply call depositBribeERC20 at BribeVault.sol#L164

3.  Since there is no deadline check and this function blindly trusts bribeIdentifier, user deposit will be success even though the associated proposal already expired

RewardIdentifier and bribeIdentifier can point to different rounds/tokens:

1.  Similar to expired proposal, depositor can generate bribeIdentifier and RewardIdentifier with different tokens and rounds.

2.  Depositor now calls epositBribeERC20 at BribeVault.sol#L164 with the generated bribeIdentifier and RewardIdentifier

3.  rewardToBribes\[rewardIdentifier].push(bribeIdentifier); will update reward for round x and bribeIdentifier will point to round y which is incorrect

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

depositBribeERC20 at [BribeVault.sol#L164](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L164) should only be allowed to be called via TokemakBribe.sol

## [[M-12] Users Can Frontrun Calls to `updateRewardsMetadata()` And Claim Tokens Twice](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel-findings/issues/118)
_Submitted by leastwood_

The `updateRewardsMetadata()` function is called by the `BribeVault` contract by the admin role. The function will take a list of distributions which are used to update the associated reward metadata. It is expected that the merkle root will be updated to correctly identify which claimers have already claimed tokens.

`reward.updateCount` is incremented to reset the claimed tracker, allowing users that may have previously claimed, to claim their updated reward. However, there is potential for mis-use if users frontrun calls to `updateRewardsMetadata()` and claim their reward after the new merkle root has been calculated and updated by the admin role. This may allow the claimer to double claim their rewards or lead to a loss in rewards if the reward metadata completely replaces the previous list of claimers.

### Proof of Concept

[RewardDistributor.sol#L97-L119](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/RewardDistributor.sol#L97-L119)<br>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider implementing a delay where users cannot claim rewards before a call to `updateRewardsMetadata()` is made. This should ensure the admin role can construct a merkle tree based on the most up-to-date and correct data.

## [[M-13] Reentrancy in `depositBribeERC20` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel-findings/issues/122)
_Submitted by Czar102, also found by 0x1f8b and SolidityScan_

[BribeVault.sol#L164-L205](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L164-L205)

`depositBribeERC20` function in `BriveVault` is reentrant in line 187, where an address supplied by the caller is called.

A bad actor that has `DEPOSITOR_ROLE` and is a contract can execute a folowing attack:

1.  Create a dummy token contract, reentrant in the transferFrom() function. All tokens are approved to the `BriveVault` and the attacker contract has unlimited tokens. Reentrancy aims back to a function in the attacker contract, which calls `depositBribeERC20` again.
2.  The first call by the contract must use a novel `bribeIdentifier`. `token` is set to a dummy contract and `amount` to `uint(-2)`.
3.  All checks pass, `transferFrom` is called, which calls attacker contract, which can call `depositBribeERC20` again, this time will transfer 1 wei of a valuable token, using the same `bribeIdentifier`. All checks pass as the previous token hasn't been registered yet. Then, a valid transfer happens. After that, the amount is set to 1 wei and the token is saved. Event is emitted and the function returns value. Then, attacker function returns and dummy token returns. The operation is to increment amount in storage by the transfer value, which increases `b.amount` to the maximum integer. The token is nonzero, so the if statement is passed.

Thus, an attacker can grant any amount of tokens from `BriveVault` to a certain bribe, stealing all the funds once the bribe will be withdrawn.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Set bribe token before the transfer is made.

## [[M-14] transferBribes could transfer before proposal deadline + Input validation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel-findings/issues/14)
_Submitted by csanuragjain, also found by gzeon and WatchPug_

It seems that Admin can call transferBribes even when proposals belonging to this rewardIdentifier have not expired. Also due to lack of input validation, token in distributions\[i].rewardIdentifier might differ from distributions\[i].token and also amount is not validated

### Proof of Concept

transferBribes could transfer before proposal deadline:

1.  Observe the transferBribes function at [BribeVault.sol#L256](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L256)
2.  This is directly distributing the rewards for a rewardIdentifier even though proposal (bribeIdentifier) linked to this rewardToBribes\[rewardIdentifier] might not have expired. This means users are still depositing and Admin transferred reward early

Input Validation:

1.  Observe the transferBribes function at [BribeVault.sol#L256](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L256)
2.  amounts object is directly passed by Admin and there is no verification to see that sum amount of all proposals under rewardToBribes\[rewardIdentifier] is equal to amount provided by admin in argument
3.  distributions\[i].token is directly passed by Admin and there is no verification to see that token under distributions\[i].rewardIdentifier is equal to the one provided by admin in argument

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Perform input validation.

> Much of the validation will be handled off-chain at the time we compute the proofs and merkle roots (we still need to write the script for that). The reason for that approach is because we will have many similar contracts (but not exactly alike - e.g. some may not have deadlines) to TokemakBribe that will interact with BribeVault. It wouldn't be feasible to validate all the different constraints on-chain. That said, the admin is a multisig and the signers will have to agree on timing and correctness of the data to prevent this from happening.

## [[M-15] Fees can be any amount](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel-findings/issues/74)
_Submitted by danb, also found by pauliax_

In `transferBribes`, the fees are user input, rather than  calculation using `fee` (state var).<br>
Currently, `fee` is unused:
[BribeVault.sol#L23](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L23).<br>

Therefore the fees amounts might be wrong.

## [[M-16] `DEPOSITOR_ROLE` can manipulate `b.amount` value](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel-findings/issues/95)
_Submitted by rfa, also found by Omik_

[BribeVault.sol#L187](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L187)<br>

Malicious `DEPOSITOR_ROLE` can doing self transfer and manipulate `b.amount`

### Proof of Concept

In case malicious `DEPOSITOR_ROLE` inputing `WETH` address and putting `briber` == address(this) in `safeTransferFrom` argument (which is self transfering). Therefore, it is posible to increase `b.amount` without any cost.

WETH token contract:

    //Line 62 WETH contract
    function transferFrom(address src, address dst, uint wad)
            public
            returns (bool)
        {
            require(balanceOf[src] >= wad);

            if (src != msg.sender && allowance[src][msg.sender] != uint(-1)) { 
                require(allowance[src][msg.sender] >= wad); 
                allowance[src][msg.sender] -= wad; // <----------- this line won't executed
            }

            balanceOf[src] -= wad;
            balanceOf[dst] += wad;

            Transfer(src, dst, wad);

            return true;
        }

If the condition didn't pass (in this case msg.sender != `src` ), the transaction will treated like a transfer (doesn't need an allowance), Therefore its possible to do self transfer

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I recommend to validate that bribe != Address(this)

## [[M-17] ThecosomataETH: Oracle price can be better secured (freshness + tamper-resistance)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel-findings/issues/49)
_Submitted by hickuphh3_

[ThecosomataETH.sol#L94-L110](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/ThecosomataETH.sol#L94-L110)<br>

The `ThecosomataETH` contract adds ETH and BTRFLY tokens as liquidity into the [ETH-BTRFLY curve crypto pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf43b15ab692fde1f9c24a9fce700adcc809d5391). The `calculateAmountRequiredForLP()` function relies on the `price_oracle` value returned by the pool to calculate the ETH and BTRFLY amounts to be added as liquidity. It is therefore important to ensure that `price_oracle` is accurate.

At the time of writing, the pool has about $5M in liquidity, which is comparable to that of the [liquidity provided on UniswapV3](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xdf9ab3c649005ebfdf682d2302ca1f673e0d37a2). Flash loan attacks are therefore possible, but ineffective (explained further later).

In the [curve v2 whitepaper](https://curve.fi/files/crypto-pools-paper.pdf), the price oracle mechanism is explained briefly in the “Algorithm for repegging” section. It is reproduced below for convenience.

> Internally, we have a price oracle given by an exponential moving average (EMA) applied in N-dimensional price space. Suppose that the last reported price is `pLast`, and the update happened `t` seconds ago while the half-time of the EMA is `T1/2`. Then the oracle price `p_new` is given as:

```jsx
α = 2^(− t / T1/2);
p_new = pLast * (1 - α) + α * p_old // p_old = current price_oracle
```

### Impact

With oracles (curve pool now, to be switched to chainlink based oracle as per comment in L27), there is an inverse correlation between freshness and tamper-resistance.

We can expect `price_oracle` to be relatively fresh as trades will occur whenever arbitrage opportunities arise against the UniV3 pool which has comparable liquidity. Note that the `ETH-BTRFLY` pool has a half-time of 10 minutes (`T1/2 = 600`). This means that after exactly 10 mins, both `pLast` and `p_old` have equal weightage.

It is unclear how resistant the EMA oracle is against manipulation. Flash loan attacks, while possible, will be ineffective because `t` will be zero (`pLast` will be ignored in the update). However, a sophisticated attacker could possibly skew the price oracle by inflating the price of `BTRFLY` a couple of blocks before the `performUpkeep()` transaction to get the treasury to deposit more `ETH` / burn more `BTRFLY` than necessary.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In my opinion, both freshness and tamper-resistance can be better secured.

This can be done by:

1.  Ensuring that the price was updated within a certain limit.

```jsx
// eg. last price update / trade must have been executed within the past hour
uint256 lastPricesTimestamp = ICurveCryptoPool(CURVEPOOL).last_prices_timestamp();
require(block.timestamp - lastPricesTimestamp <= 1 hours, 'stale price');
```

2.  Checking that the last reported price `pLast` has not deviated too far from the current oracle price `p_old`. One can argue that it would be safer to add liquidity when the market isn’t volatile.

```jsx
uint256 lastPrice = ICurveCryptoPool(CURVEPOOL).last_prices();
uint256 oraclePrice = ICurveCryptoPool(CURVEPOOL).price_oracle();
uint256 percentDiff;
// eg. require difference in prices to be within 5%
if (lastPrice > oraclePrice) {
  percentDiff = (lastPrice - oraclePrice) * 1e18 / oraclePrice;
} else {
  percentDiff = (oraclePrice - lastPrice) * 1e18 / oraclePrice;
}
require(percentDiff <= 5e16, 'volatile market');
```

## [[M-18] Rewards can be lost](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel-findings/issues/13)
_Submitted by csanuragjain_

Reward can be lost if bribeVault calls the updateRewardsMetadata on same rewardIdentifier again before user can claim his reward (since merkleRoot and proof will get updated).

### Proof of Concept

1.  bribeVault calls the updateRewardsMetadata at [RewardDistributor.sol#L97](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/RewardDistributor.sol#L97) using rewardIdentifier X
2.  Assume  \_distributions\[i].proof contains merkle proof for User A
3.  User A fails to call claim function
4.  bribeVault again calls the updateRewardsMetadata at RewardDistributor.sol#L97 using rewardIdentifier X updating  \_distributions\[i].proof  which might not contain merkle proof of User A now. So User A loses his rewards

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

bribeVault should only make second call to updateRewardsMetadata on same rewardIdentifier when all claimers have made their claims.

## Codebase Impressions & Summary

This audit scope consisted of 4 contracts. Overall, the code quality is great. Inline comments and documentation provided was adequate. Various parties / roles and contract interactions were well explained.

Most issues raised are minor improvements to improve the security of the contracts. The only notable findings made had to do with the usage of the curve crypto pool’s price oracle, and protection against sandwich attacks when adding liquidity.

In addition, I made a suggestion regarding the syncing of Tokemak’s rounds with the `TokemakBribe` contract.

Note that I refrained raising issues regarding FoT tokens because I assume they are not meant to be supported.

## [L-01] RewardDistributor: Change `payable(account).transfer()` to `.call()` for native fund transfers

### Line References

[RewardDistributor.sol#L181](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/RewardDistributor.sol#L181)<br>

### Description

`BribeVault` uses `.call()` for native fund transfers, but `RewardDistributor` uses `.transfer()`. They should be standardized to `.call()`, the currently recommended method since [`.transfer()` fowards 2300 gas whereas `.call()` forwards all / set gas.](https://solidity-by-example.org/sending-ether/)

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

```jsx
(bool sentAccount, ) = _account.call{value: _amount}("");
require(sentAccount, "Failed to transfer to _account");
```

## [L-02] BribeVault: Use `safeTransfer` for tokens

### Line References

[BribeVault.sol#L296-L297](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L296-L297)<br>
[BribeVault.sol#L337](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L337)

### Description

Some ERC20 tokens like ZRX don’t revert if the transfer fails. Since the `SafeERC20` has already been imported and the `safeTransferFrom` method used, the same should be done for token transfers.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Replace `transfer` with `safeTransfer`.

## [L-03] RewardDistributor: Limit native fund transfers to `bribeVault`

### Line References

[RewardDistributor.sol#L58-L59](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/RewardDistributor.sol#L58-L59)

### Description

Since the only source of native fund transfers is expected to be the `bribeVault` contract, it would be good to restrict incoming fund transfers from other sources to prevent accidental transfers.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

```jsx
receive() external payable {
  require(msg.sender == bribeVault, 'only bribeVault');
}
```

## [L-04] TokemakBribe: Sync rounds with Tokemak’s manager instead of manually setting rounds via `setRound()`

### Line References

### Description

Instead of manually setting rounds, consider fetching the round number directly from Tokemak’s manager contract via `[manager.currentCycleIndex()](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa86e412109f77c45a3bc1c5870b880492fb86a14#readProxyContract)`. While I initially wrote an issue about being able to set previous round numbers, after having chatted with the sponsor, it is intended to be a feature, not a bug.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

```jsx
// TODO: change _round to getRound() wherever it is called in other internal functions
function getRound() public view returns (uint256) {
  // if round is overridden, return set value
  if (_round != 0) return _round;
  // otherwise, if value is 0, use Tokemak's currentCycleIndex()
  // Tokemak manager at 0xa86e412109f77c45a3bc1c5870b880492fb86a14
  return manager.currentCycleIndex();
}
```

### Description

*   Missing `round` param
*   `bribeAmount` has incorrect description

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

```jsx
/**

## [N-02] Emit relevant events in constructor methods when variables are set, or abstract to internal functions

### Line References

[BribeVault.sol#L59-L74](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L59-L74)<br>

[RewardDistributor.sol#L51-L56](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/RewardDistributor.sol#L51-L56)

### Description

Some variables are set in the constructor method but do not emit events, unlike their setter counterparts. For instance, `bribeVault` in the `RewardDistributor` contract fails to emit the `SetBribeVault` event, but this is emitted in the `setBribeVault()` function.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Either emit the events in the constructor, or make the setter functions public and have the constructor call it.

## [G-01] Adding unchecked directive can save gas

_Note: minor optimation, the amount of gas saved is minor, change when you see fit._

For the arithmetic operations that will never over/underflow, using the unchecked directive (Solidity v0.8 has default overflow/underflow checks) can save some gas from the unnecessary internal over/underflow checks.

For example:

[ThecosomataETH.sol#L118-L118](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/92c4d5810df7b9de15eae55dc7641c8b36cd799d/contracts/ThecosomataETH.sol#L118-L118)

## [G-02] Using immutable variable can save gas

_Note: Suggested optimation, save a decent amount of gas without compromising readability._

[TokemakBribe.sol#L28-L28](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/92c4d5810df7b9de15eae55dc7641c8b36cd799d/contracts/TokemakBribe.sol#L28-L28)<br>

```solidity
    address public bribeVault;
```

[TokemakBribe.sol#L60-L65](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/92c4d5810df7b9de15eae55dc7641c8b36cd799d/contracts/TokemakBribe.sol#L60-L65)<br>

```solidity
    constructor(address _bribeVault) {
        require(_bribeVault != address(0), "Invalid bribeVault");
        bribeVault = _bribeVault;

        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
    }
```

Considering that `bribeVault` will never change, changing it to immutable variable instead of storage variable can save gas.

## [G-03] Remove redundant access control checks can save gas

_Note: suggested optimation, save a decent amount of gas without compromising readability._

[TokemakBribe.sol#L125-L135](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/92c4d5810df7b9de15eae55dc7641c8b36cd799d/contracts/TokemakBribe.sol#L125-L135)<br>

```solidity
    function setProposal(address proposal, uint256 deadline)
        public
        onlyAuthorized
    {
        require(proposal != address(0), "Invalid proposal");
        require(deadline >= block.timestamp, "Deadline must be in the future");

        proposalDeadlines[proposal] = deadline;

        emit SetProposal(proposal, deadline, _round);
    }
```

[TokemakBribe.sol#L142-L157](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/92c4d5810df7b9de15eae55dc7641c8b36cd799d/contracts/TokemakBribe.sol#L142-L157)<br>

```solidity
    function setProposals(
        address[] calldata proposals,
        uint256[] calldata deadlines
    ) external onlyAuthorized {
        require(proposals.length > 0, "Need at least 1 proposal");
        require(
            proposals.length == deadlines.length,
            "Must be equal # of proposals and deadlines"
        );

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < proposals.length; i += 1) {
            setProposal(proposals[i], deadlines[i]);
        }

        emit SetProposals(proposals, deadlines, _round);
    }
```

`setProposal()` already got `onlyAuthorized` check, and `setProposals()` will check it again multiple times.

Consider creating `_setProposal()` private function without access control and call it inside the public functions.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change to:

```solidity
    function _setProposal(address proposal, uint256 deadline)
        private
    {
        require(proposal != address(0), "Invalid proposal");
        require(deadline >= block.timestamp, "Deadline must be in the future");

        proposalDeadlines[proposal] = deadline;
    }

    /**
        @notice Set a single proposal
        @param  proposal  addresss Proposal address
        @param  deadline  uint256  Proposal deadline
     */
    function setProposal(address proposal, uint256 deadline)
        public
        onlyAuthorized
    {
        _setProposal(proposal, deadline);
        emit SetProposal(proposal, deadline, _round);
    }

    /**
        @notice Set multiple proposals
        @param  proposals  address[]  Proposal addresses
        @param  deadlines  uint256[]  Proposal deadlines
     */
    function setProposals(
        address[] calldata proposals,
        uint256[] calldata deadlines
    ) external onlyAuthorized {
        require(proposals.length > 0, "Need at least 1 proposal");
        require(
            proposals.length == deadlines.length,
            "Must be equal # of proposals and deadlines"
        );

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < proposals.length; i += 1) {
            _setProposal(proposals[i], deadlines[i]);
        }

        emit SetProposals(proposals, deadlines, _round);
    }
```

## [G-04] Validation can be done earlier to save gas

_Note: suggested optimation, save a decent amount of gas without compromising readability._

Check if `ethLiquidity > 0 && btrflyLiquidity > 0` earlier can avoid unnecessary external call (`IRedactedTreasury(TREASURY).manage(WETH, ethLiquidity);`) when this check failed.

[ThecosomataETH.sol#L124-L155](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/92c4d5810df7b9de15eae55dc7641c8b36cd799d/contracts/ThecosomataETH.sol#L124-L155)<br>

```solidity
    function performUpkeep() external onlyOwner {
        require(checkUpkeep(), "Invalid upkeep state");

        uint256 btrfly = IBTRFLY(BTRFLY).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 ethAmount = calculateAmountRequiredForLP(btrfly, true);
        uint256 ethCap = IERC20(WETH).balanceOf(TREASURY);
        uint256 ethLiquidity = ethCap > ethAmount ? ethAmount : ethCap;

        // Use BTRFLY balance if remaining capacity is enough, otherwise, calculate BTRFLY amount
        uint256 btrflyLiquidity = ethCap > ethAmount
            ? btrfly
            : calculateAmountRequiredForLP(ethLiquidity, false);

        IRedactedTreasury(TREASURY).manage(WETH, ethLiquidity);

        // Only complete upkeep only on sufficient amounts
        require(ethLiquidity > 0 && btrflyLiquidity > 0, "Insufficient amounts");
        // ...
    }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change to:

```solidity
    function performUpkeep() external onlyOwner {
        require(checkUpkeep(), "Invalid upkeep state");

        uint256 btrfly = IBTRFLY(BTRFLY).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 ethAmount = calculateAmountRequiredForLP(btrfly, true);
        uint256 ethCap = IERC20(WETH).balanceOf(TREASURY);
        uint256 ethLiquidity = ethCap > ethAmount ? ethAmount : ethCap;

        // Use BTRFLY balance if remaining capacity is enough, otherwise, calculate BTRFLY amount
        uint256 btrflyLiquidity = ethCap > ethAmount
            ? btrfly
            : calculateAmountRequiredForLP(ethLiquidity, false);

        // Only complete upkeep only on sufficient amounts
        require(ethLiquidity > 0 && btrflyLiquidity > 0, "Insufficient amounts");

        IRedactedTreasury(TREASURY).manage(WETH, ethLiquidity);

        // ...
    }
```

## [G-05] `type(uint256).max` is more gas efficient than `2**256 - 1`

_Note: minor optimation, the amount of gas saved is minor, change when you see fit._

[ThecosomataETH.sol#L68-L69](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/92c4d5810df7b9de15eae55dc7641c8b36cd799d/contracts/ThecosomataETH.sol#L68-L69)

## [G-06] `10e18` is more gas efficient than `10**18`

_Note: minor optimation, the amount of gas saved is minor, change when you see fit._

[ThecosomataETH.sol#L102-L108](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/92c4d5810df7b9de15eae55dc7641c8b36cd799d/contracts/ThecosomataETH.sol#L102-L108)

## [G-07] Cache array length in for loops can save gas

_Note: suggested optimation, save a decent amount of gas without compromising readability._

Reading array length at each iteration of the loop takes 6 gas (3 for mload and 3 to place memory_offset) in the stack.

Caching the array length in the stack saves around 3 gas per iteration.

[TokemakBribe.sol#L147-L152](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/92c4d5810df7b9de15eae55dc7641c8b36cd799d/contracts/TokemakBribe.sol#L147-L152)

[BribeVault.sol#L261-L275](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/92c4d5810df7b9de15eae55dc7641c8b36cd799d/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L261-L275)

[RewardDistributor.sol#L80-L82](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/92c4d5810df7b9de15eae55dc7641c8b36cd799d/contracts/RewardDistributor.sol#L80-L82)

## [G-08] Avoid unnecessary storage read can save gas

_Note: Suggested optimation, save a decent amount of gas without compromising readability_

[BribeVault.sol#L213-L248](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/92c4d5810df7b9de15eae55dc7641c8b36cd799d/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L213-L248)<br>

```solidity
    function depositBribe(
        bytes32 bribeIdentifier,
        bytes32 rewardIdentifier,
        address briber
    ) external payable onlyRole(DEPOSITOR_ROLE) {
        require(bribeIdentifier.length > 0, "Invalid bribeIdentifier");
        require(rewardIdentifier.length > 0, "Invalid rewardIdentifier");
        require(briber != address(0), "Invalid briber");
        require(msg.value > 0, "Value must be greater than 0");

        Bribe storage b = bribes[bribeIdentifier];
        address currentToken = b.token;
        require(
            // For native tokens, the token address is set to this contract to prevent
            // overwriting storage - the address can be anything but address(this) safer
            currentToken == address(0) || currentToken == address(this),
            "Cannot change token"
        );

        b.amount += msg.value; // Allow bribers to increase bribe

        // Only set the token address and update the reward-to-bribe mapping if not yet set
        if (currentToken == address(0)) {
            b.token = address(this);
            rewardToBribes[rewardIdentifier].push(bribeIdentifier);
        }

        emit DepositBribe(
            bribeIdentifier,
            rewardIdentifier,
            b.token,
            msg.value,
            b.amount,
            briber
        );
    }
```

Based on L224~~L230, L235~~L236, we know that `b.token == address(this)`, therefore at L243 `b.token` can be replaced with `address(this)`.

Use `address(this)` directly can avoid unnecessary storage read of `b.token` and save some gas.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Replace:

```solidity
emit DepositBribe(
    bribeIdentifier,
    rewardIdentifier,
    b.token,
    msg.value,
    b.amount,
    briber
);
```

with:

```solidity
emit DepositBribe(
    bribeIdentifier,
    rewardIdentifier,
    address(this),
    msg.value,
    b.amount,
    briber
);
```
